    "Here, we are using Logistic Regression as the base model for RandomizedSearchCV. We have defined a hyperparameter grid to search over that includes the regularization parameter (C), penalty function (penalty), and solver method (solver).\n",
    "\n",
    "The range of values for C is chosen as a logarithmic range from 0.0001 to 10000. The penalty function is chosen as L1 and L2, and the solver method is chosen as liblinear and saga.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have set the number of iterations (n_iter) to 50 and the number of cross-validation folds (cv) to 5, which determines how many times the data will be split into training and validation sets during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we fit the RandomizedSearchCV object to the training data, predict on the test set, and report the train and test accuracy, classification report, and best hyperparameters found during the search.\n",

    "Note that the hyperparameters and their ranges were chosen based on empirical evidence and prior knowledge about the Logistic Regression classifier. The choice of hyperparameters and their ranges may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset."
