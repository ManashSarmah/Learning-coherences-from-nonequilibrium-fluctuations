    "Here, we are using Decision Tree Classifier as the base model for RandomizedSearchCV. We have defined a hyperparameter grid to search over that includes the maximum depth of the tree (max_depth), minimum number of samples required to split a node (min_samples_split), minimum number of samples required at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf), and the criterion used for splitting ('gini' or 'entropy').\n",
    "\n",
    "The range of values for each hyperparameter are chosen based on prior knowledge about the classifier and the problem at hand. For example, we have set the range of values for max_depth from 1 to 20, as we know that having a very deep tree may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have set the number of iterations (n_iter) to 50 and the number of cross-validation folds (cv) to 5, which determines how many times the data will be split into training and validation sets during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we fit the RandomizedSearchCV object to the training data, predict on the test set, and report the train and test accuracy, classification report, and best hyperparameters found during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the hyperparameters and their ranges were chosen based on empirical evidence and prior knowledge about the Decision Tree Classifier. The choice of hyperparameters and their ranges may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset."
